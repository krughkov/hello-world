# hello-world
My test and sandbox repository

Giving this one a shot and trying to see what is unique about it, as well as how hard or easy is it to use ... how intuitive is it?

## Pros
Very good documentation
I like the discussion process prior to the official merge

## Cons
Some items are still hard to find, always need to go to the main menue to start drilling down

### Note
More to come, this is just the first 5 min of using github
